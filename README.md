## Overview
The largest online retailer Amazing Prime Video is sponsoring a hackathon requesting participants to determine which low-budget movies will become popular box office films. Amazing Prime Video plans to obtain rights to the potentially popular movies for their streaming service. The purpose of this project is to assist their team in creating the list of movies to be used for the hackathon. To this end, I create a extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline to automate the data wrangling process. The pipeline is implemented on one dataset of all movies released after 1990 from Wikipedia and another dataset of movie ratings from MovieLens in Kaggle. The resulting clean data is stored within a SQL database.
